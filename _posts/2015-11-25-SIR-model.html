<h1> Implementing and solving the SIR model in Python </h1>
<br>
<br>
<p> This project will use the following Python packages that is not included as standard and have to be installed manually.</p>
<br>
<p> Matplotlib</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2> The SIR Model </h2>
<br>
<p>The SIR model is a simplistic model used to describe the transmission of disease. For more information about is se  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic_model">THIS</a> Wikipedia article. The thing that makes this model interesting as a coding example is because it is a example of a system of differential equations. Models like this will often not have an analytical solution. One simple way to solve them will then be to use numerical methods implemented using some programming language.</p>
<br>
<br>
<strong>The model is described using three differential equations:</strong>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p> \( \frac{dS}{dt} = - \frac{\beta S I}{N}\)</p>
<br>
<p> \( \frac{dI}{dt} =\frac{\beta S I}{N} - \gamma I \)</p>
<br>
<p> \( \frac{dR}{dt} =\gamma I \) </p>
<br>
<br>
<strong> Where </strong>
    <ul>
        <li> \(S(t)\) represents the number of individuals not yet infected at time t </li>
        <li> \(I(t)\) represents the number of individuals that have been infected and are capable of spreading the disease </li>
        <li> \(R(t)\) represents those who have been infected and then cured and further immune to the disease </li>
        <li> \(N\) is the total population. In this example we assumes that the total number is constant </li>
        <li> \(\beta\) is the contact rate. The higher the contact rate the faster the disease spreads </li>
        <li> \(\frac{1}{\gamma} \) Average infectious period, higher \(\gamma  \) equals lower infectious period </li>
    </ul>
<br>
<br>
<h2> Solving using numerical methods </h2>
<br>
<p> The first step to solve this is first to transform the problem using Euler method. There are lots of different methods that can be used, but the Euler method is one of the simplest.</p>
<br>
<p> \( S_i = S_{i-1} - \frac{\beta S_{i-1} I_{i-1} }{N} \vartriangle t\)</p>
<br>
<p> \( I_i = I_{i-1} + \frac{\beta S_{i-1} I_{i-1} }{N} \vartriangle t - \gamma I_{i-1} \vartriangle t \)</p>
<br>
<p> \( R_i = R_{i-1} + \gamma I  \vartriangle t \) </p>
<br>
<p> This system of equations can now be solved if we are given the initial conditions for \(S_0\), \(I_0 \), and \(R_0\) in addition to values for \(\delta \) and \(\gamma \).</p>
<br>
<br>
<p> For this example those are: </p>
    <ul>
        <li> \(S_0 = 1500\) </li>
        <li> \(I_0 = 1\) </li>
        <li> \(R_0 = 0\)  </li>
        <li> \(\gamma = 0.1\) </li>
    </ul>
<br>
<p> And we want to see how the disease develops over the time period from \(t = 0 \) to \(t = 60 \) days, with time increments \(\vartriangle t = 0.5\). . In addition we can see from the equations that the total population should remain constant equal to \(S_0 + I_0 + R_0 \). To check that the implementation is correct we can add in a condition that checks that this is true for each iteration given some margin of error. I implement the system in a function where we can choose the beta value.</p>

def run(beta):

    #initial and parameter values
    v = 0.1
    S0 = 1500
    I0 = 1.0
    R0 = 0.0
    T = 60
    dt = 0.5
    n = int(T / dt)

    #list's to save the results from each iteration
    list_S = []
    list_I = []

    #Setting up the intial setup before the loop
    S = S0

    #Used to check that the model is implemented correctly
    total = S0 + I0 + R0
    tol = 0.10

    for i in range(n+1):
        S_n = S - dt * beta * S * I
        I_n = I + dt * beta * S * I - dt * v * I
        R_n = R + dt * v * I
        t += dt

        list_S.append(S_n)

    #Condition to cheack for correct implementation
        if abs((S + I + R) - total) < tol:
            continue
        else:
            print ('total sum of S, I, R is wrong, closing program')
            break

    #Plotting the result in a graph
    plt.plot(list_t, list_S)
    plt.plot(list_t, list_I)
    plt.plot(list_t, list_R)
    plt.xlabel('Time in days')
    plt.ylabel('People')
    plt.legend(['Suspectibles', 'Infected', 'Resistant'], loc=4)

    plt.show()


#Runs the script for beta = 0.0005
run(0.0005)

#Runs the script for beta = 0.0010
run(0.0010)

#Runs the script for beta = 0.0003
run(0.0001)

<br>
<p> And this is the resulting figures showing the evolution of the disease given different beta values</p>

    <img src = "{{site.baseurl}}/img/SIR/beta 0.0005.png" >
<br>
<br>
    <img src = "{{site.baseurl}}/img/SIR/beta 0.0010.png" >
<br>
<br>
    <img src = "{{site.baseurl}}/img/SIR/beta 0.0001.png" >
</center>
<br>
<br>
<p> Can be seen from this that a higher beta lets the disease spread faster, but in return it is over faster. And a beta value of 0.0001 or less prevents the disease from starting to spread throughout the population.</p>
