<h2> I have created this site as a fun way to learn to code in HTML and CSS, and to have a place to store and display my other coding projects. This site is created using the Jekyll static site generator and hosted on Github. Most of the projects will be created using Pyton 3 since this is my primary language, but for some of the projects I will also try to do a Javascript implementation that can be run inside the browser. </h2>
